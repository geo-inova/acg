This repository facilitates a project related to INOVA AreaCAD-GIS concept - set of software tools for establishing, maintaining and analysis of urban spatially-related structures. Based on popular CAD, GIS and BIM platforms, project integrates expert knowledge on spatial planning and infrastructure networks design using Unity 3D, Autodesk Revit and AutoCAD applications and related APIs. The goal is to create beforementioned platform bindings using INSPIRE standards, while leveraging game-like ease of use when it comes to design, simulation and reporting workflows. For more information please see repository Wiki, or contact project manager [Maksim Sestic](https://github.com/SesticM).
